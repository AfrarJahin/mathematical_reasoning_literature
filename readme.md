# Mathematical Reasoning Literature Review Repository

A structured and scalable repository for collecting, comparing, and synthesizing research papers focused on Mathematical Reasoning.

This repository is designed for long-term PhD research workflows, enabling consistent documentation across hundreds of papers with a unified review schema.

## Repository Purpose

The goal of this repository is to support systematic literature review by:

- Tracking paper metadata and technical contributions in a standardized format
- Comparing methods, datasets, and evaluation practices across studies
- Recording critical analysis (strengths, limitations, and research relevance)
- Maintaining reproducible references and optional BibTeX integration
