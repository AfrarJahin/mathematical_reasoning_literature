# Mathematical Reasoning Literature Tracker

Structured literature tracker on mathematical reasoning papers. This table is designed for scalable review workflows (100+ papers) with consistent comparison fields.

## Usage Notes

- Fill each blank cell after reviewing the full paper and supplementary materials.
- Keep method names consistent across rows (e.g., SFT, DPO, RL, Multi-Agent, Neuro-Symbolic).
- Use short, evidence-based entries for `Strength`, `Weakness`, and `Gaps`.
- Add new papers by appending rows and preserving numbering.
