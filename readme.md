# Mathematical Reasoning Literature Review Repository

A structured repository for collecting, comparing, and synthesizing research papers on mathematical reasoning in AI/ML.  
The schema is designed for long-term PhD workflows and scales to hundreds of papers.

## Purpose

- Maintain consistent metadata and technical summaries for each paper.
- Compare methods, datasets, and evaluation practices across studies.
- Record strengths, weaknesses, and unresolved research gaps.
- Support reproducible referencing via stable links and optional BibTeX.

## Literature Review Table

Use one row per paper. Keep entries concise, technical, and evidence-based.

## Entry Conventions

- `Year`: use publication year; include month only when relevant for preprints.
- `Venue`: standardize names (e.g., `NeurIPS`, `ICLR`, `ICML`, `AAAI`, `arXiv`).
- `Dataset`: list benchmark names only (e.g., `GSM8K`, `MATH`, `AIME`).
- `Method`: short category plus key mechanism (e.g., `DPO with flow matching`).
- `Gaps`: prioritize issues such as robustness, generalization, compute cost, or data dependence.



## License and Use

- Repository notes and tables can use `CC BY 4.0` (or your chosen project license).
- Linked papers remain the intellectual property of their original authors/publishers.
